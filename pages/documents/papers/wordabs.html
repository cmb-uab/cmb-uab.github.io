WS-SNPs&GO: a web server for predicting the deleterious effect of human protein variants  functional annotation
SNPs&GO is a method for the prediction of deleterious Single Amino acid Polymorphisms (SAPs)  protein functional annotation. In this work, we present the web server implementation of SNPs&GO (WS-SNPs&GO). The server is  on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and for a given protein, its input comprises: the sequence and/or its -dimensional structure (when available), a set of target variations and its functional Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The output of the server provides, for each protein variation, the probabilities to be associated to human diseases.
The server consists of  main components, including updated versions of the sequence- SNPs&GO (recently scored as one of the  algorithms for predicting deleterious SAPs) and of the structure- SNPs&GO3d programs. Sequence and structure  algorithms are extensively tested on a large set of annotated variations extracted from the SwissVar database. Selecting a balanced dataset with more than 38,000 SAPs, the sequence- approach achieves 81% overall accuracy, 0.61 correlation coefficient and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.88. For the subset of ~6,600 variations mapped on protein structures available at the Protein Data Bank (PDB), the structure- method scores with 84% overall accuracy, 0.68 correlation coefficient, and 0.91 AUC. When tested on a new blind set of variations, the results of the server are 79% and 83% overall accuracy for the sequence- and structure- inputs, respectively.
WS-SNPs&GO is a valuable tool that includes in a unique framework information derived from protein sequence, structure, evolutionary profile, and protein function.

Collective judgment predicts disease-associated  nucleotide variants
In recent years the number of human genetic variants deposited into the publicly available databases has been increasing exponentially. The latest version of dbSNP, for example, contains ~50 million validated Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs). SNVs make up most of human variation and are often the primary causes of disease. The g-syymous SNVs (nsSNVs) result in  amino acid substitutions and  affect protein function, often ca disease. Although several methods for the detection of nsSNV effects have already been developed, the consistent increase in annotated data is offering the opportunity to improve prediction accuracy.
Here we present a new approach for the detection of disease-associated nsSNVs (Meta-SNP) that integrates four existing methods: PANTHER, PhDSNP, SIFT and SNAP. We  tested the accuracy of each method  a dataset of 35,766 disease-annotated mutations from 8,667 proteins extracted from the SwissVar database. The four methods  overall accuracies of 64%-76% with a Matthew's correlation coefficient (correlation) of 0.38-0.53. We then g the outputs of these methods to develop a machine learning  approach that discriminates  disease-associated and polymorphic variants (Meta-SNP). In testing, the combined method  79% overall accuracy and 0.59 correlation, ~3% higher accuracy and ~0.05 higher correlation with respect to the -performing method. Moreover, for the hardest-to-define subset of nsSNVs, i.e. variants for which half of the predictors disagreed with the other half, Meta-SNP attained 8% higher accuracy than the  predictor.
Here we find that the Meta-SNP algorithm achieves  performance than the   predictor. This result suggests that the methods g for the prediction of variant-disease associations are orthogonal, encoding different biologically relevant relationships. Careful combination of predictions from various resources is therefore a good strategy for the selection of high reliability predictions. Indeed, for the subset of nsSNVs where all predictors were in agreement (46% of all nsSNVs in the set), our method  87% overall accuracy and 0.73 correlation.

Using tertiary structure for the computation of highly accurate multiple RNA alignments with the SARA-Coffee package.
Aligning RNAs is useful to search for homologous genes, study evolutionary relationships, detect conserved regions and identify any patterns that  be of biological relevance. Poor levels of conservation g homologs, however, make it difficult to compare RNA sequences, even when considering closely evolutionary related sequences.
We describe SARA-Coffee, a tertiary structure- multiple RNA aligner, which has been validated  BRAliDARTS, a new benchmark framework designed for evaluating tertiary structure- multiple RNA aligners. We provide  methods to measure the capacity of alignments to match corresponding secondary and tertiary structure features. On this benchmark, SARA-Coffee outperforms both regular aligners and those  secondary structure information. Furthermore, we  that on sequences in which 60% of the nucleotides form base , primary sequence methods usually perform  than secondary-structure aware aligners.

Bioinformatics and variability in drug response: a protein structural perspective.
Marketed drugs frequently perform worse in clinical practice than in the clinical trials on which their approval is . Many therapeutic compounds are ineffective for a large subpopulation of patients to whom they are prescribed; worse, a significant fraction of patients experience adverse effects more severe than anticipated. The unacceptable risk-benefit profile for many drugs mandates a paradigm shift towards personalized medicine. However, prior to adoption of patient-specific approaches, it is useful to understand the molecular details underlying variable drug response g diverse patient populations. Over the past decade, progress in structural genomics led to an explosion of available -dimensional structures of drug target proteins while efforts in pharmacogenetics offered insights into polymorphisms correlated with differential therapeutic outcomes. Together these advances provide the opportunity to examine how altered protein structures arising from genetic differences affect protein-drug interactions and, ultimately, drug response. In this review, we  summarize structural characteristics of protein targets and common mechanisms of drug interactions. Next, we describe the impact of coding mutations on protein structures and drug response. Finally, we highlight tools for analysing protein structures and protein-drug interactions and discuss their application for understanding altered drug responses associated with protein structural variants.

Bioinformatics for personal genome interpretation.
An international consortium released the  draft sequence of the human genome 10 years ago. Although the analysis of this data has suggested the genetic underpinnings of many diseases, we have not yet been able to fully quantify the relationship  genotype and phenotype. Thus, a major current effort of the scientific community focuses on evaluating individual predispositions to specific phenotypic traits given their genetic backgrounds. Many resources aim to identify and annotate the specific genes responsible for the observed phenotypes. Some of these use intra-species genetic variability as a means for  understanding this relationship. In addition, several online resources are now dedicated to collecting  nucleotide variants and other types of variants, and annotating their functional effects and associations with phenotypic traits. This information has enabled researchers to develop bioinformatics tools to analyze the rapidly increasing amount of newly extracted variation data and to predict the effect of uncharacterized variants. In this work, we review the most important developments in the field--the databases and bioinformatics tools that will be of utmost importance in our concerted effort to interpret the human variome.

Phased -genome genetic risk in a family quartet  a major allele reference sequence.
Whole-genome sequencing harbors unprecedented potential for characterization of individual and family genetic variation. Here, we develop a novel synthetic human reference sequence that is ethnically concordant and use it for the analysis of genomes from a nuclear family with history of familial thrombophilia. We demonstrate that the use of the major allele reference sequence results in improved genotype accuracy for disease-associated variant loci. We infer recombination sites to the lowest median resolution demonstrated to date ( 1,000 base ). We use family inheritance state analysis to control sequencing error and inform family-wide haplotype phasing, allowing quantification of genome-wide compound heterozygosity. We develop a sequence- methodology for Human Leukocyte Antigen typing that contributes to disease risk prediction. Finally, we advance methods for analysis of disease and pharmacogenomic risk across the coding and g-coding genome that incorporate phased variant data. We  these methods are capable of identifying multigenic risk for inherited thrombophilia and informing the appropriate pharmacological therapy. These ethnicity-specific, family- approaches to interpretation of genetic variation are emblematic of the next generation of genetic risk assessment  -genome sequencing.


A new disease-specific machine learning approach for the prediction of cancer-ca missense variants.
High-throughput genotyping and sequencing techniques are rapidly and inexpensively providing large amounts of human genetic variation data. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are an important source of human genome variability and have been implicated in several human diseases, including cancer. Amino acid mutations resulting from g-syymous SNPs in coding regions  generate protein functional changes that affect cell proliferation. In this study, we developed a machine learning approach to predict cancer-ca missense variants. We present a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on a set of 3163 cancer-ca variants and an equal number of neutral polymorphisms. The method achieve 93% overall accuracy, a correlation coefficient of 0.86, and area under ROC curve of 0.98. When compared with other previously developed algorithms such as SIFT and CHASM our method results in higher prediction accuracy and correlation coefficient in identifying cancer-ca variants.

Improving the prediction of disease-related variants  protein -dimensional structure.
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are an important source of human genome variability. Non-sygymous SNPs occurring in coding regions result in  amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs) that  affect protein function and lead to pathology. Several methods attempt to estimate the impact of SAPs  different sources of information. Although sequence- predictors have n good performance, the quality of these predictions can be further improved by introducing new features derived from -dimensional protein structures.
In this paper, we present a structure- machine learning approach for predicting disease-related SAPs. We have trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) on a set of 3,342 disease-related mutations and 1,644 neutral polymorphisms from 784 protein chains. We use SVM input features derived from the protein's sequence, structure, and function. After dataset balancing, the structure- method (SVM-3D) reaches an overall accuracy of 85%, a correlation coefficient of 0.70, and an area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92. When compared with a similar sequence- predictor, SVM-3D results in an increase of the overall accuracy and AUC by 3%, and correlation coefficient by 0.06. The robustness of this improvement has been tested on different datasets and in all the cases SVM-3D performs  than previously developed methods even when compared with PolyPhen2, which explicitly considers in input protein structure information.
This work demonstrates that structural information can increase the accuracy of disease-related SAPs identification. Our results also quantify the magnitude of improvement on a large dataset. This improvement is in agreement with previously observed results, where structure information enhanced the prediction of protein stability changes  mutation. Although the structural information contained in the Protein Data Bank is limiting the application and the performance of our structure- method, we expect that SVM-3D will result in higher accuracy when more structural date become available.

Bioinformatics challenges for personalized medicine
Widespread availability of low-cost, full genome sequencing will introduce new challenges for bioinformatics.
This review outlines recent developments in sequencing technologies and genome analysis methods for application in personalized medicine. New methods are needed in four areas to realize the potential of personalized medicine: (i) processing large-scale robust genomic data; (ii) interpreting the functional effect and the impact of genomic variation; (iii) integrating systems data to relate complex genetic interactions with phenotypes; and (iv) translating these discoveries into medical practice.

Comparative modeling: the state of the art and protein drug target structure prediction.
The goal of computational protein structure prediction is to provide -dimensional (3D) structures with resolution comparable to experimental results. Comparative modeling, which predicts the 3D structure of a protein  on its sequence similarity to homologous structures, is the most accurate computational method for structure prediction. In the last  decades, significant progress has been made on comparative modeling methods. Using the large number of protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (~65,000), automatic prediction pipelines are generating a tremendous number of models (~1.9 million) for sequences whose structures have not been experimentally determined. Accurate models are suitable for a wide range of applications, such as prediction of protein binding sites, prediction of the effect of protein mutations, and structure-guided virtual screening. In particular, comparative modeling has enabled structure- drug design against protein targets with unknown structures. In this review, we describe the theoretical basis of comparative modeling, the available automatic methods and databases, and the algorithms to evaluate the accuracy of predicted structures. Finally, we discuss relevant applications in the prediction of important drug target proteins, foc on the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and protein kinase families.

All-atom knowledge- potential for RNA structure prediction and assessment.
Over the recent years, the vision that RNA simply serves as information transfer molecule has dramatically changed. The study of the sequence/structure/function relationships in RNA is becoming more important. As a direct consequence, the total number of experimentally solved RNA structures has dramatically increased and new computer tools for predicting RNA structure from sequence are rapidly emerging. Therefore, new and accurate methods for assessing the accuracy of RNA structure models are clearly needed.
Here, we introduce an all-atom knowledge- potential for the assessment of RNA -dimensional (3D) structures. We have benchmarked our new potential, called Ribonucleic Acids Statistical Potential (RASP), with  different decoy datasets composed of near-native RNA structures. In one of the benchmark sets, RASP was able to rank the closest model to the X-ray structure as the  and within the top 10 models for ∼93 and ∼95% of decoys, respectively. The average correlation coefficient  model accuracy, calculated as the root mean square deviation and global distance test-total score (GDT-TS) measures of C3' atoms, and the RASP score was 0.85 and 0.89, respectively. Based on a recently released benchmark dataset that contains hundreds of 3D models for 32 RNA motifs with g-caical base , RASP scoring function compared favorably to ROSETTA FARFAR force field in the selection of accurate models. Finally,  the self-splicing group I intron and the stem-loop IIIc from hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry site as test cases, we  that RASP is able to discriminate  known structure-destabilizing mutations and compensatory mutations.

The -dimensional folding of the α-globin gene domain reveals formation of chromatin globules.
We developed a general approach that combines chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C) with the Integrated Modeling Platform (IMP) to generate high-resolution -dimensional models of chromatin at the megabase scale. We applied this approach to the ENm008 domain on human chromosome 16, containing the α-globin locus, which is expressed in K562 cells and silenced in lymphoblastoid cells (GM12878). The models accurately reproduce the known looping interactions  the α-globin genes and their distal regulatory elements. Further, we find  our approach that the domain folds into a  globular conformation in GM12878 cells, whereas  globules are formed in K562 cells. The central cores of these globules are enriched for transcribed genes, whereas gtranscribed chromatin is more peripheral. We propose that globule formation represents a higher-order folding state related to clustering of transcribed genes around shared transcription machineries, as previously observed by microscopy.

Quantifying the relationship  sequence and -dimensional structure conservation in RNA.
In recent years, the number of available RNA structures has rapidly grown reflecting the increased interest on RNA biology. Similarly to the studies carried out  decades ago for proteins, which gave the fundamental grounds for developing comparative protein structure prediction methods, we are now able to quantify the relationship  sequence and structure conservation in RNA.
Here we introduce an all-against-all sequence- and -dimensional (3D) structure- comparison of a representative set of RNA structures, which have allowed us to quantitatively confirm that: (i) there is a measurable relationship  sequence and structure conservation that weakens for alignments resulting in below 60% sequence identity, (ii) evolution tends to conserve more RNA structure than sequence, and (iii) there is a twilight zone for RNA homology detection.
The computational analysis here presented quantitatively describes the relationship  sequence and structure for RNA molecules and defines a twilight zone region for detecting RNA homology. Our work could represent the theoretical basis and limitations for future developments in comparative RNA 3D structure prediction.

Functional annotations improve the predictive score of human disease-related mutations in proteins.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the simplest and most frequent form of human DNA variation, also valuable as genetic markers of disease susceptibility. The most investigated SNPs are missense mutations resulting in residue substitutions in the protein. Here we propose SNPs&GO, an accurate method that, starting from a protein sequence, can predict whether a mutation is disease related or not by exploiting the protein functional annotation. The scoring efficiency of SNPs&GO is as high as 82%, with a Matthews correlation coefficient equal to 0.63 over a wide set of annotated gsyymous mutations in proteins, including 16,330 disease-related and 17,432 neutral polymorphisms. SNPs&GO collects in unique framework information derived from protein sequence, evolutionary information, and function as encoded in the Gene Ontology terms, and outperforms other available predictive methods.

SARA: a server for function annotation of RNA structures.
Recent interest in g-coding RNA transcripts has resulted in a rapid increase of deposited RNA structures in the Protein Data Bank. However, a characterization and functional classification of the RNA structure and function space have only been partially addressed. Here, we introduce the SARA program for pair-wise alignment of RNA structures as a web server for structure- RNA function assignment. The SARA server relies on the SARA program, which aligns  RNA structures  on a unit-vector root-mean-square approach. The likely accuracy of the SARA alignments is assessed by  different P-values estimating the statistical significance of the sequence, secondary structure and tertiary structure identity scores, respectively. Our benchmarks, which relied on a set of 419 RNA structures with known SCOR structural class, indicate that at a negative logarithm of mean P-value higher or equal than 2.5, SARA can assign the correct or a similar SCOR class to 81.4% and 95.3% of the benchmark set, respectively. 

RNA structure alignment by a unit-vector approach.
The recent discovery of tiny RNA molecules such as microRNAs and small interfering RNA are transforming the view of RNA as a simple information transfer molecule. Similar to proteins, the native -dimensional structure of RNA determines its biological activity. Therefore, classifying the current structural space is paramount for functionally annotating RNA molecules. The increasing numbers of RNA structures deposited in the PDB requires more accurate, automatic and benchmarked methods for RNA structure comparison. In this article, we introduce a new algorithm for RNA structure alignment  on a unit-vector approach. The algorithm has been implemented in the SARA program, which results in RNA structure pairwise alignments and their statistical significance.
The SARA program has been implemented to be of general applicability even when no secondary structure can be calculated from the RNA structures. A benchmark against the ARTS program  a set of 1275 g-redundant pairwise structure alignments results in inverted approximately 6% extra alignments with at least 50% structurally superposed nucleotides and base . A  attempt to perform RNA automatic functional annotation  on structure alignments indicates that SARA can correctly assign the deepest SCOR classification to 60% of the query structures.

A -state prediction of   mutations on protein stability changes.
A basic question of protein structural studies is to which extent mutations affect the stability. This question  be addressed starting from sequence and/or from structure. In proteomics and genomics studies prediction of protein stability free energy change (DDG)    mutation  also help the annotation process. The experimental DDG values are affected by uncertainty as measured by standard deviations. Most of the DDG values are nearly zero (about 32% of the DDG data set ranges from -0.5 to 0.5 kcal/mole) and both the value and sign of DDG  be either positive or negative for the  mutation blurring the relationship g mutations and expected DDG value. In order to overcome this problem we describe a new predictor that discriminates  3 mutation classes: destabilizing mutations (DDG -1.0 kcal/mol), stabilizing mutations (DDG 1.0 kcal/mole) and neutral mutations (-1.0=DDG =1.0 kcal/mole).
In this paper a SVM vector machine starting from the protein sequence or structure discriminates  stabilizing, destabilizing and neutral mutations. We rank all the possible substitutions according to a  state classification system and  that the overall accuracy of our predictor is as high as 56% when performed starting from sequence information and 61% when the protein structure is available, with a mean value correlation coefficient of 0.27 and 0.35, respectively. These values are about 20 s per cent higher than those of a random predictor.
Our method improves the quality of the prediction of the free energy change due to   protein mutations by adopting a hypothesis of thermodynamic reversibility of the existing experimental data. By this we both recast the thermodynamic symmetry of the problem and balance the distribution of the available experimental measurements of free energy changes. This eliminates possible overestimations of the previously described methods trained on an unbalanced data set comprising a number of destabilizing mutations higher than stabilizing ones.

Computational RNA Structure Prediction
The view of RNA as simple information transfer molecule has been continuously challenged since the discovery of ribozymes, a class of RNA molecules with enzyme-like function. Moreover, the recent discovery of tiny RNA molecules such as μRNAs and small interfering RNA, is transforming our thinking about how gene expression is regulated. Thus, RNA molecules are now known to carry a large repertory of biological functions within cells including information transfer, enzymatic catalysis and regulation of cellular processes. Similar to proteins, functional RNA molecules fold into their native -dimensional (3D) conformation, which is essential for performing their biological activity. Despite advances in understanding the folding and unfolding of RNA, our knowledge of the atomic mechanism by which RNA molecules adopt their biological active structure is still limited. In this review, we outline the general principles that govern RNA structure and describe the databases and algorithms for analyzing and predicting RNA secondary and tertiary structure. Finally, we assess the impact of the current coverage of the RNA structural space on comparative modeling RNA structures.

Use of estimated evolutionary strength at the codon level improves the prediction of disease-related protein mutations in humans.
Predicting the functional impact of protein variation is one of the most challenging problems in bioinformatics. A rapidly growing number of genome-scale studies provide large amounts of experimental data, allowing the application of rigorous statistical approaches for predicting whether a given   mutation has an impact on human health. Up until now, existing methods have limited their source data to either protein or gene information. Novel in this work, we take advantage of both and focus on protein evolutionary information by  estimated selective pressures at the codon level. Here we introduce a new method (SeqProfCod) to predict the likelihood that a given protein variant is associated with human disease or not. Our method relies on a SVM vector machine (SVM) classifier trained   sources of information: protein sequence, multiple protein sequence alignments, and the estimation of selective pressure at the codon level. SeqProfCod has been benchmarked with a large dataset of 8,987   mutations from 1,434 human proteins from SWISS-PROT. It achieves 82% overall accuracy and a correlation coefficient of 0.59, indicating that the estimation of the selective pressure helps in predicting the functional impact of - mutations. Moreover, this study demonstrates the synergic effect of combining  sources of information for predicting the functional effects of protein variants: protein sequence/profile- information and the evolutionary estimation of the selective pressures at the codon level.

K-Fold: a tool for the prediction of the protein folding kinetic order and rate.
K-Fold is a tool for the automatic prediction of the protein folding kinetic order and rate. The tool is  on a SVM vector machine (SVM) that was trained on a data set of 63 proteins, whose 3D structure and folding mechanism are known from experiments already described in the literature. The method predicts whether a protein of known atomic structure folds according to a -state or a multi-state kinetics and correctly classifies 81% of the folding mechanisms when tested over the training set of the 63 proteins. It also predicts as a further option the logarithm of the folding rate. To the  of our knowledge, the tool discriminates for the  time whether a protein is characterized by a  state or a multiple state kinetics, during the folding process, and concomitantly estimates also the value of the constant rate of the process. When g to predict the logarithm of the folding rate, K-Fold scores with a correlation value to the experimental data of 0.74 (with a SE of 1.2).

The WWWH of remote homolog detection: the state of the art.
The detection of remote homolog  of proteins  computational methods is a pivotal problem in structural bioinformatics, aiming to compute protein folds on the basis of information in the database of known structures. In the last 25 years, several methods have been developed to tackle this problem,  on different approaches including sequence-sequence alignments and/or structure comparison. In this article, we will briefly discuss When, Why, Where and How (WWWH) to perform remote homology search, reviewing some of the most widely adopted computational approaches. The specific aim is highlighting the basic criteria implemented by different research groups and commenting on the status of the art as well as on still-open questions.

Diffusion-collision of foldons elucidates the kinetic effects of  mutations and suggests control strategies of the folding process of helical proteins.
In this article we use mutation studies as a benchmark for a minimal model of the folding process of helical proteins. The model ascribes a pivotal role to the collisional dynamics of a few crucial residues (foldons) and predicts the folding rates by exploiting information drawn from the protein sequence. We  that our model rationalizes the effects of  mutations on the kinetics of folding. The folding times of  proteins and their mutants are predicted. Stability and location of foldons have a critical role as the determinants of protein folding. This allows us to elucidate  main mechanisms for the kinetic effects of mutations. First, it turns out that the mutations eliciting the most notable effects alter protein stability through stabilization or destabilization of the foldons. Secondly, the folding rate is affected via a modification of the foldon topology by those mutations that lead to the birth or death of foldons. The few mispredicted folding rates of some mutants hint at the limits of the current version of the folding model proposed in the present article. The performance of our folding model declines in case the mutated residues are subject to strong long-range forces. That foldons are the critical targets of mutation studies has notable implications for design strategies and is of particular interest to address the issue of the kinetic regulation of  proteins in the general context of the overall dynamics of the interactome.

Predicting the insurgence of human genetic diseases associated to   protein mutations with SVM vector machines and evolutionary information.
Human  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most frequent type of genetic variation in human population. One of the most important goals of SNP projects is to understand which human genotype variations are related to Mendelian and complex diseases. Great interest is focg on g-syymous coding SNPs (nsSNPs) that are responsible of protein   mutation. nsSNPs can be neutral or disease associated. It is known that the mutation of only one residue in a protein sequence can be related to a number of pathological conditions of dramatic social impact such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Creutzfeldt-Jakob's diseases. The quality and completeness of presently available SNPs databases allows the application of machine learning techniques to predict the insurgence of human diseases due to   protein mutation starting from the protein sequence.
In this paper, we develop a method  on SVM vector machines (SVMs) that starting from the protein sequence information can predict whether a new phenotype derived from a nsSNP can be related to a genetic disease in humans. Using a dataset of 21 185   mutations, 61% of which are disease-related, out of 3587 proteins, we  that our predictor can reach more than 74% accuracy in the specific task of predicting whether a   mutation can be disease related or not. Our method, although  on less information, outperforms other web-available predictors implementing different approaches.

Hierarchical mechanochemical switches in angiostatin.
We wish to propose a novel mechanism by which the triggering of a biochemical signal can be controlled by the hierarchical coupling  a protein redox equilibrium and an external mechanical force. We have characterized this mechanochemical mechanism in angiostatin, and we have evidence that it can switch the access to partially unfolded structures of this protein. We have identified a metastable intermediate that is specifically accessible under thioredoxin-rich reducing conditions, like those met by angiostatin on the surface of a tumor cell. The structure of the  intermediate accounts for the unexplained antiangiogenic activity of angiostatin. These findings demonstrate a new link  redox biology and mechanically regulated processes.

A minimal model of -state folding dynamics of helical proteins.
A diffusion-collision-like model is proposed for helical proteins with -state folding dynamics. The model generalizes a previous scheme  on the dynamics of putatively essential parts of the protein (foldons) that was successfully tested on proteins with -state folding. We  that the extended model, unlike the original one, allows satisfactory calculation of the folding rate and reconstruction of the salient steps of the folding pathway of  proteins with -state folding (Im7 and p16). The dramatic reduction of variables achieved by foc on the foldons makes our model a good candidate for a minimal description of the folding process also for -state folders. Finally, the applicability of the foldon diffusion-collision model to -state and -state folders suggests that different folding mechanisms are amenable to conceptually homogeneous descriptions. The implications for a unification of the variety of folding theories so far proposed for helical proteins are discussed in the final discussion.

IMutant2.0: predicting stability changes  mutation from the protein sequence or structure.
IMutant2.0 is a SVM vector machine (SVM)- tool for the automatic prediction of protein stability changes    mutations. IMutant2.0 predictions are performed starting either from the protein structure or, more importantly, from the protein sequence. This latter task, to the  of our knowledge, is exploited for the  time. The method was trained and tested on a data set derived from ProTherm, which is presently the most comprehensive available database of thermodynamic experimental data of free energy changes of protein stability  mutation under different conditions. IMutant2.0 can be g both as a classifier for predicting the sign of the protein stability change  mutation and as a regression estimator for predicting the related DDG values. Acting as a classifier, IMutant2.0 correctly predicts (with a cross-validation procedure) 80% or 77% of the data set, depending on the usage of structural or sequence information, respectively. When predicting DDG values associated with mutations, the correlation of predicted with expected/experimental values is 0.71 (with a standard error of 1.30 kcal/mol) and 0.62 (with a standard error of 1.45 kcal/mol) when structural or sequence information are respectively adopted. Our web interface allows the selection of a predictive mode that depends on the availability of the protein structure and/or sequence. In this latter case, the web server requires only pasting of a protein sequence in a raw format. We therefore introduce IMutant2.0 as a unique and valuable helper for protein design, even when the protein structure is not yet known with atomic resolution.

Predicting protein stability changes from sequences  SVM vector machines.
The prediction of protein stability change  mutations is key to understanding protein folding and misfolding. At present, methods are available to predict stability changes only when the atomic structure of the protein is available. Methods addressing the  task starting from the protein sequence are, however, necessary in order to complete genome annotation, especially in relation to  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and related diseases.
We develop a method  on SVM vector machines that, starting from the protein sequence, predicts the sign and the value of free energy stability change    mutation. We  that the accuracy of our predictor is as high as 77% in the specific task of predicting the DDG sign related to the corresponding protein stability. When predicting the DDG values, a satisfactory correlation agreement with the experimental data is also found. As a final blind benchmark, the predictor is applied to proteins with a set of disease-related SNPs, for which thermodynamic data are also known. We found that our predictions corroborate the view that disease-related mutations correspond to a decrease in protein stability.

A neural-nerk- method for predicting protein stability changes    mutations.
One important requirement for protein design is to be able to predict changes of protein stability  mutation. Different methods addressing this task have been described and their performance tested considering global linear correlation  predicted and experimental data. Neither is direct statistical evaluation of their prediction performance available, nor is a direct comparison g different approaches possible. Recently, a significant database of thermodynamic data on protein stability changes    mutation has been generated (ProTherm). This allows the application of machine learning techniques to predicting free energy stability changes  mutation starting from the protein sequence.
In this paper, we present a neural-nerk- method to predict if a given mutation increases or decreases the protein thermodynamic stability with respect to the native structure. Using a dataset consisting of 1615 mutations, our predictor correctly classifies 80% of the mutations in the database. On the  task and  the  data, our predictor performs  than other methods available on the Web. Moreover, when our system is coupled with energy- methods, the joint prediction accuracy increases up to 90%, suggesting that it can be g to increase also the performance of pre-existing methods, and generally to improve protein design strategies.

Dynamics of the minimally frustrated helices determine the hierarchical folding of small helical proteins.
In this paper we aim at determining the key residues of small helical proteins in order to build up reduced models of the folding dynamics. We start by arguing that the folding process can be dissected into concurrent fast and slow dynamics. The fast events are the quasiautonomous coil-to-helix transitions occurring in the minimally frustrated initiation sites of folding in the early stages of the process. The slow processes consist in the docking of the fluctuating helices formed in these critical sites. We  that a neural nerk devised to predict native secondary structures from sequence can be g to estimate the probabilities of formation of these helical traits as they are embedded in the protein. The resulting probabilities are n to correlate well with the experimental helicities measured in the  isolated peptides. The relevance of this finding to the hierarchical character of folding is confirmed within the framework of a diffusion-collision-like mechanism. We demonstrate that thermodynamic and topological features of these critical helices allow accurate estimation of the folding times of five proteins that have been kinetically studied. This suggests that these critical helices determine the fundamental events of the  folding process. A remarkable feature of our model is that not all of the native helices are eligible as critical helices, whereas the  set of the native helices has been used so far in other reconstructions of the folding mechanism. This stresses that the minimally frustrated helices of these helical proteins comprise the minimal set of determinants of the folding process.
A Shang entropy- filter detects high- quality profile-profile alignments in searches for remote homologues.
Detection of homologous proteins with low-sequence identity to a given target (remote homologues) is routinely performed with alignment algorithms that take advantage of sequence profile. In this article, we investigate the efficacy of different alignment procedures for the task at hand on a set of 185 protein  with similar structures but low-sequence similarity. Criteria  on the SCOP label detection and MaxSub scores are adopted to score the results. We investigate the efficacy of alignments  on sequence-sequence, sequence-profile, and profile-profile information. We confirm that with profile-profile alignments the results are  than with other procedures. In addition, we report, and this is novel, that the selection of the results of the profile-profile alignments can be improved by  Shang entropy, indicating that this parameter is important to recognize good profile-profile alignments g a plethora of meaningless . By this, we enhance the global search accuracy without losing sensitivity and filter out most of the erroneous alignments. We also  that when the entropy filtering is adopted, the quality of the resulting alignments is comparable to that computed for the target and template structures with CE, a structural alignment program.
