     Introduction to Scientific Computing (GBS 746 - Special Topics) </b>
     <br>
     <br>
	The purpose of this course is to provide and introduction to the main computational skills required
	for scientific computing. Specifically, the participants are exposed to practical use of standard
	web available resources and computational tools for the managing molecular biology data. A
	successful participation includes the development of scripts and programs for analyzing large-scale
	data. 1.00 Credit hours.<br><br>
        The syllabus with detailed information about the location and time of the course is available

     <li><b>Rational and History</b><br> 
     Nowadays we are in the Big Data era. This is characterized by the collection of a huge amount of 
     data so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database 
     management tools or traditional data processing applications. In the near future, the main 
     challenges will include, curation, storage, search, sharing, analysis, and visualization of these 
     data. This exponential trend to larger set of data is evident in biomedical sciences where 
     cheaper high-throughput sequencing techniques are providing a huge amount of biomolecular 
     data and connection between worldwide health institution can provide access to large set of 
     medical data through the EMRs. According to this scenario future researchers in biomedical 
     science will need to deal with large amount of data to deliver high quality research. To bridge 
     the gap between experimental and in silico investigators in biomedical sciences, we introduce 
     this course particularly designed for people with low level of expertise in informatics that would 
     like to learn basic scientific computing skill to improve their research. 
     </li>
     <br>
     <li><b>Organization</b><br>
     This course is organized as a hands-on training for graduate students, faculty and 
     computational staff. A limited number of slots are made available for Pathology residents, 
     fellows and graduate students with interests in learning basic computing skills for research 
     purpose. The first part of the course will be dedicated to the installation/configuration of Linux 
     operating system. The attendees will became familiar with the most important command lines in 
     UNIX shell. In the second part of the course student will learn about a scripting language 
     (Python and/or Perl) understanding the basic data structure types and build-in functions 
     available for them. In the final part of the course an introduction the R Project for Statistical 
     Computing will be provided to perform basic statistical analysis. 
     </li>
     <br>
     <li><b>Evaluation</b><br>
     Evaluation is based on class participation and project development. The attendees are required 
     to present the implemented scripts and programs at the end of the course. 
     </li><br>
     <li><b>Additional Information</b><br>
     Cap class at 20 students<br>
     Lecture Course<br> 
     Attendees should bring their personal laptops (preferably Mac or Linux) to the class.<br>
     </li><br>
     <li><b>Materials</b><br>
     All the materials and course evaluation for the first edition of CB2-101 Introdution to Scientific Computing 
     (17-28 February, 2014) are available at the following <a href="./documents/courses/2014/cb2-101.html">web page</a>.
